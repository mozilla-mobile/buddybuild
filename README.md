Tap the Install on your device link. BuddyBuild will tell you to register your device first.

## Step 2 - Register your Device

If this is the first time you use BuddyBuild to try out an app, you will be asked to register your device.

Hit install in the top right. You have to confirm by entering your passcode. At the end of this process you should be back in Safari and redirected to the app install page. If not, open the link in the email again.

## Step 5 - Download and Install the App

Hit *Download and Install* and you should be going through a bunch of screens.
